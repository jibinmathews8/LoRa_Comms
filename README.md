# LoRa_Comms
Project Lab 3 Code (Digital Communications)

This code allows utilization of communication between modules using the Ebyte E32-900T20D (https://www.cdebyte.com/products/E32-900T20D)
The library used, "Ebyte.h" is developed from Kris Kasprzak (https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/EBYTE). THis library is utilized in order to program and change parameters of these devices.  

To recreate these modules the following is needed:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Ebyte E32900T20D (Works with other Ebyte E32 Modules. Have not tested with the E220 but will in the future)
3. Logic Level Shifters: Ebyte Logic pins require 3.3V so a LLC is necessary
